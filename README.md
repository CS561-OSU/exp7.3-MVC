# Exploration 7.3: Task Manager App
Using React.js, this project implements two versions of a simple task manager that users can use to add and remove tasks, and mark tasks as complete:

* The version in `feature/simple-task-manager` uses React's built-in state management to manage tasks.
* The version in `feature/mvc-task-manager` demonstrates the use of the MVC architectural pattern to manage tasks.

The README file in `feature/mvc-task-manager` provides a detailed explanation of the MVC pattern and how it is implemented in the task manager app.
