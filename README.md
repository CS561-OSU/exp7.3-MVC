# MVC Task Manager
This is a simple task manager application that uses the MVC design pattern. It is written in React.js

## Evolution from the version in `feature/simple-task-manager`

1. Starting Point - Single Component Implementation
   "Let's start by examining our original TaskManager component:
   - All state management, logic, and UI in one place
   - Common starting point for React developers
   - Works fine for simple applications
   - Shows clear responsibilities that we can separate"

2. Identifying MVC Opportunities
   "Looking at our original code, we can identify three distinct concerns:
   - Data Management (tasks array and operations) → Model
   - User Interface (form and list rendering) → View
   - Event Handling (connecting user actions to data changes) → Controller"

3. Benefits of Separation
   "Why would we want to separate these concerns?
   - Model: Business logic can be reused with different UIs
   - View: UI can be modified without touching business logic
   - Controller: Coordination logic can adapt to different models/views
   - Testing becomes more focused and manageable"

4. The Model Transformation
   "Converting our state management into a Model:
   - Created a custom hook (useTaskModel)
   - Encapsulated all task-related state and operations
   - Made operations reusable and independent of UI
   - Provides a clean interface: {tasks, addTask, toggleTask, deleteTask}"

5. The View Transformation
   "Extracting the UI into a View component:
   - Pure presentation logic
   - Receives data and callbacks as props
   - No knowledge of how tasks are stored or managed
   - Only concerned with rendering and user input"

6. The Controller's Role
   "Adding the Controller as the coordinator:
   - Connects Model operations to View events
   - Provides necessary data to the View
   - Handles the 'how' of connecting pieces
   - Keeps Model and View decoupled"

7. Practical Benefits
   "This separation provides tangible benefits:
   - Want a different UI? Create a new View
   - Need to change how tasks are stored? Modify the Model
   - Need to add new features? Controller manages the flow"

8. Trade-offs to Consider
   "Important to understand the costs:
   - More initial code to write
   - More files to manage
   - More complex component relationships
   - May be overkill for simple applications"
